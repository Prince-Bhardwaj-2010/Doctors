    <h4 class="card-title">Dr. Chris Simpson</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Dr. Chris Simpson, MD FRCPC FACC FHRS FCCS FCAHS (born 1967) is a Canadian cardiologist who served as the 147th President of the Canadian Medical Association (2014–2015).[1] During his tenure, he championed seniors' care,[2] arguing that a more comprehensive and integrated approach to the care of seniors would serve as a foundation for improving the Canadian healthcare system as a whole.[3][4] Other issues during his term included a national discussion on end of life care [5] (that coincided with a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that struck down the ban on medical aid in dying (MAID)[6] and new legislation allowing MAID),[7] as well as issues around the public health implications and possible medicinal utility of cannabis.[8]</p>
